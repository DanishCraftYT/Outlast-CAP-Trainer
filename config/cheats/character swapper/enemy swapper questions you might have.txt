why can't i find the enemy i want to replace?
if you want to replace chris with something you can't. simply because the way chris walker works.
or it chould be because i still hasn't released it yet.

which characters can i not replace?
CAN REPLACE
chris walker
any patient
miles upshur

CAN'T REPLACE
dr trager

MIGHT WORK
eddie gluskin
frank

UNKNOWN
wallrider

why using a modded version?
it makes editing the hex code inside the file a lot easier.

what does "stable/unstable/very unstable" mean?
if it's stable. it means it has minor bugs/no bugs at all.
if it's unstable. it means it has a lot of bugs or it has a major bug.
if it's very unstable. it means the textures might not work properly or it has a lot of major bugs.

hopefully this helped you
